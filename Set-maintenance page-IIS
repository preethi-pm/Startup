<# This script is to put a web application running on IIS offline and display a maintenance message. The application essentially shuts down the site, unloads it from the server, and stops processing any requests to that site.Â All requests to that website will redirect to that app_offline.htm file. The script looks for sharepoint and sp2010 root folders under under D:\websites\  and drops the file app_offline.htm.
